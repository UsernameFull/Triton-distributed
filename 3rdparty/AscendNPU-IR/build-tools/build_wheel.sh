    SYNOPSIS:
      build_wheel.sh [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -b, --build-dir DIR    Path to the build directory containing bishengir-compile binary
                             (Default: ${BUILD_DIR})
      -h, --help             Print this help message
      -o, --output-dir DIR   Output directory for the wheel package
                             (Default: ${WHEEL_DIR}/dist)
      --clean                Clean the build artifacts before building
      --upload               Upload to PyPI after building (requires twine)

    Examples:
      # Build with default settings
      ./build_wheel.sh

      # Build with custom build directory
      ./build_wheel.sh --build-dir /path/to/build

      # Build and upload to PyPI
      ./build_wheel.sh --upload
